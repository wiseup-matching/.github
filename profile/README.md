## üìñ About this Project

WiseUp was conceived, designed, and implemented as part of the  
[Software Engineering for Business Applications (SEBA) Master‚Äôs course](https://wwwmatthes.in.tum.de/pages/1mqqqoqe7gapz/Software-Engineering-for-Business-Applications-SEBA-Master) at TUM.  

As part of this course, we:
- **Ideated** the concept and value proposition.  
- **Developed** a business plan and matching model.  
- **Created** customer journeys, personas, and UI mockups.  
- **Implemented** the platform as a working web application (frontend & backend).  

wiseup-matching contains the **frontend and Backend implementation** of that project.

## TL;DR

- **What**: Frontend of the WiseUp matchmaking platform.  
- **Why**: Startups lack budget for senior expertise; retirees want meaningful, flexible work. WiseUp matches both sides efficiently.  
- **How**: A smooth, passwordless UX with guided sign-up, search, automatic matches, and in-app chat.

## 1) Problem We Solve

Early-stage startups need targeted expertise but cannot afford full-time hires or big-firm consulting. Meanwhile, many healthy, motivated retirees want to keep contributing on their own terms.  

WiseUp bridges that gap with a curated, two-sided marketplace and matching flow that turns **experience into momentum** for startups and **meaning into work** for retirees.
